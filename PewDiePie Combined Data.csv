"4:30 On the screen time thing, I did zero screen time with my oldest until she was two and my youngest sister went to school for early childhood development and learned something really interesting about screen time with kids and why it is so bad for them. The way that we transmit images through a screen reacts with our brains in a particular way. It's the same phenomena that makes it difficult to fall asleep after watching screens. The way that affects a child's brain is effectively like a drug. The screen is giving them a endorphin (or it might have been dopamine, i get those mixed up XP) high while the screen is on. And then as soon as you turn it off, their body processes that so quickly that they tend to go through a mini withdrawal.

That's why often times when kids get too much screen time, you notice it because they're constantly going through that withdrawal process and acting like little terrors.

"I agree with EVERYTHING you said Felix. About parenting. Everything. The infant phase was so stressful I actually had PTSD and severe anxiety for two years afterwards. I agree also, having your kid grow and being able to do things with them makes the relationship so much more rewarding. Maybe I was an atypical mother, but for me there was nothing relaxing, natural or fulfilling about the infant stage. Things make a lot more sense and feel way more natural and instinctive now that my child is 3 and can talk fluently and ask questions.

When time came for me to speak, I was fluently using all 3 languages. We lived in a village, so I knew the preferred language of neighbours and spoke it with that particular person.

"I've been raised bilingual, my parents speaking different languages to me was probably best. How you described you with Swedish, Marzia with Italian, both with English,  then and maybe Japanese out in public would be good.

日本語も上達しましたね！

私も、日本で子育てする親の1人です。
私も夫も日本人ですが、その私達ですら、「どこで子育てするのが、私達、子ども達にとって、一番良いのか？」ということを、毎日毎日毎日考えています。
日本国内だけでも、4か所に住みました。その中には東京もあれば、地方もあります。
なんていうか、場所の違いによって、民度も違うし、気候も違うし、合う合わない（日本語の言い回しで、場所が合わない事を「水が合わない」と言ったりします）もあったりして、難しいです。
でも、なんていうか、人との出会いかなー、と思うことが最近多いです。
あとは、食が合うかどうか。日本国内でも、さまざまな食の違いがあるので、それによっても合う合わないありますね。
Pewdiepie が、家族みんなが、合う場所はどこでしょうね。とにかく人と触れ合ってみることを、おすすめします。
日本語は、他言語話者にとっては難しいのですが、とても自由度が高くて、でも小さなニュアンスまでもが表現できたりする、面白い言語です。
日本に住んでいるうちに、沢山話して、その面白さに気付いてもらえたら、嬉しいです。
あと、災害時に不安というのは、とても分かります。日本は自然災害も多いので。日本の携帯キャリアのスマホは契約していますか？docomo、ソフトバンク、au、それぞれに災害情報を伝えるサービスや機能が備わっています。もちろん、英語でも確認することができます。ぜひ、それらを使うことをおすすめしたいです。

Because we all understand the same situation of being here away from home, so if they could find that I am sure they will find things to be a lot easier.

"Swedish, Italian, Japanese aaand English speaking child...Are you creating the most op MC of the language speaking rubicon in the universe?

Once Bjorn will start talking he will be able to use all in a limited scope as well. If you want to stay in japan and raise Lil Bjorn over there your main focus should be on the language that will help him the most...if you want to travel around the world then english is the best option still. Raising him as a swedish italian viking will never be an option though. You will overload your kid for marizas or your families benefit and it will not help him for sure. Think about it Pewds: you want to teach a baby to speak 4 languages. Bjorn will have enough problems being the kid of the most famous YTvber as it is and you will not be able to shelter him from this also. Trying to teach him 4 languages on top of that? Are you sure you are up for the storm of puberty you will create for him? You already threw your kid to the internet sharks as he is right now.

"My five year old is my forever baby. She’s special needs because of Batten Disease CLN1 and nonverbal. We’ve discovered she prefers a lot of older cartoons like Disney’s Robin Hood and The Rescuers. She likes newer stuff like Moana too, but too much new stuff wears her out so we play a lot of older stuff in between. Absolutely cannot put Cocomelon or Dino Ranchers on though. It’s easier to notice in a special needs child with epilepsy but I’m sure it’s as bad for healthier children too.

Bluey, Blue’s Clues (the one with Steve) and Bear in the Big Blue house are all really great. On a side note, currently her most favorite thing isn’t even cartoons. It’s the bouncy school bus she’s been riding on with her nurse since she started kindergarten!

"I mean this in the most positive way possible. The bar for “a good father” has been set so low historically through previous generations that the emergence of social media has made fathers look like super dads by simply existing, participating and sharing. However I think that it’s necessary to share and speak about fatherhood to remove that low bar and make men comfortable to speak about their role and decisions surrounding having a baby. There has always been magazines, tv-shows and profiles discussing motherhood which has in some ways always made the topic present in females lives. Felix wanting to share and discuss fatherhood to his broad audience allows a space for men to open up about the discussion of parenting. 
Of course it’s not necessary to make a big deal about it and make parallels towards men speaking about parenthood but I still think it should be celebrated for the overall topic of parenthood within couples where the role of research and discussion mostly have been given to women historically. 
I as many grew up watching Felix, my partner did it too. I’ve consumed motherhood media consciously and unconsciously for years whilst this is one of few my partner has watched ever. 
Parenthood affects both parents, therefore I’m so glad that the discussion is more and more visible and available for fathers today. Partially thanks to you Felix. You alone helps raise the bar for fathers and how it’s actually fun to be one which previous media hasn’t always portrayed it to be.

"After spending my tweens, teens, and early twenties right into the pandemic having to co-parent and babysit my sister's 4 kids, I knew once Pewds had his first child he'd change his tune about them lol. 

One thing I'll say though is that It's such a privilege to be financially stable enough to have both parents stay at home and raise a child. The mental and physical exhaustion of having to work a job or jobs and stress about money and providing everything for your family and also missing out on raising your kids because of working so much is one of the reasons why a lot of parents have such a hard time. Nowadays, at least in America, both parents (if they are still together), have to work to afford the cost of living and the kid gets put in daycare for 9 hours a day (or in my case a family member is forced to take care of them and not have a life of their own)

"You sound like the best kind of parent; the kind that sometimes questions yourself and whether you're doing a good job. I was a classroom teacher for 10 years and in that time, the ones whose parents were often doubting themselves and asking me for advice, were actually the best parents with the happiest kids. It sounds like you are just letting your kid be a kid and that's so beautiful to see. Pewtiful even . 😉

I totally agree about balance. As a child I was kept off screens COMPLETELY and although I think it did good things for my developing brain in general, I had trouble as an adult balancing myself. I became so obsessed with gaming and movies that I would forget to sleep. I think if you grow up with a healthy balance of screen time and what I'd call ""body time"" (exercising, getting sun on your face, eating good food etc.), it becomes easier to maintain that balance as an adult, because you're used to getting both and will notice if you're missing anything. 

I think the way you are already talking to him a lot will make sure he grows up knowing the language really well. I believe the more he hears of a language is what actually matters for learning, because he's soaking up all the words, even if he's not saying many of them yet. The research shows that growing up multilingual makes it very easy for kids to learn new languages AND it makes them really good learners overall. 

You look like you're doing a fantabulous job with being a parent, thank you for sharing ❤

"The language question is a good one. My theory has been that it's better to master your native tongue first, then learn the language of the country you live in. I realized this because I was born in Asia, learned to read and write before my family migrated to an English speaking country. Growing up, I had friends who moved before they learned to read and write and the difference in our mother tongue was staggering. I actually tested this with my own child because I moved back to my country of origin, raised my kid until he was ready to go to school, then migrated to an English speaking country again. He struggled for about a year to pick up English but now he's perfectly bilingual.

About the anxiety of looking ahead in to the future i will say to just take it a day at a time. I know it's easy for me to say but just take a deep breath and have that moment to yourself and think it through. You might not see into the future 10-15 years from now but i think you can do baby steps and plan for the next 2 years or something that you find more realistic and repeat that process. Planning for 10 years from now will just cause you stress just trying to be ahead of things. Plan for the here and now and like i said maybe the next 2 years. Also it may not seem like it but you said something that's really important for someone in your position. I guess anyone really. It's having purpose again. Strong words in my opinion. I'm not sure i understood the meaning behind the title but i watch all the way i guess enjoy every moment of life and spend as much time as possible with the people you love.

"*Also, I wish Parents would STOP making it so ""complicated"" when having a Baby and they wake at night....*
All you have to do is have a large enough bed, you put the baby in the MIDDLE of the Bed with two small pillows on each side, and then when the baby wakes up and needs to be fed, or changed, the mother just rolls over and feeds the baby, and then whomever changes it if that's what's needed.  It does NOT have to be such a ""big deal"".  Putting baby's in a crib a long way away, or in other rooms etc. is just STUPID.  My system is EASY, makes it much less stressful, and you get more sleep.  3 boys, I proved it.

Then once they can start sleeping more through the night, you put them in a small bed/crib next to your bed, then when they are fully sleeping through, not breastfeeding anymore, you put them in their own room if you have an extra room.

"بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم . 
أدعوكم إلى دين الحق(دين الإسلام). 
سيندم من لا يدخل هذا الدين . 
نحن المسلمون لنا الحياة التي تأتي بعد الموت
إلى المالا نهاية وهي دار الخلود (الجنة). 
فأنصح كل من ليس على دين الإسلام أن يدخل في دين الإسلام فورا . 
في يوم القيامة يأمر الله الملائكة في النفخ في البوق ويموت كل من على وجه الأرض ،ويأمر الملائكة مرة أخرى فينبعث كل من في الأرض إلى مكان يسمى (المحشر)،وكل إنسان في هذا المكان تتسلط عليه الشمس حسب أعماله في الدنيا ،إن كانت أعماله صالحة فيظلل عليه بغيمة باردة،ومن كانت أعماله سيئة فتسلط عليه الشمس على كامل جسده وتكون الشمس قريبة عليه بنسبة قريبة جداً،ويصيب الناس في أرض المحشر الجوع والعطش الشديد، فيذهبون إلى أصحاب النبي محمد لكي يشفعوا للناس ولكنهم يقولون لسنا لها لسنا لها،فيذهبون الناس إلى رسول الله محمد لكي يشفع لهم
فيقبل الله شفاعته ويبدأ العرض على الله تعالى 
نذهب من أرض المحشر إلى العرض فمن كان كافرا في الدنيا فإنه يأخذ صحيفة أعماله في يده اليسرى
ومن كان مسلما وعمله صالح في الدنيا يأخذ صحيفة أعماله بيده اليمنى ،بعد هذه المرحلة تأتي مرحلة الحساب على الأعمال ،فمن كان مسلما وعمله صالح فهو يسلم من النار ،ومن كان كافرا وعمل ليس صالحا فمصيره النار ،ثم بعد مرحلة الحساب نذهب إلى المرور فوف (السّراط المستقيم) وهو حبل نحيف جدا تحته يوجد وادي من أودية جهنم فمن عبر (السّراط المستقيم) فهو في أمان ،ومن يقع عن هذا الحبل فهو في خطر شديد ،ثم بعد هذه المرحلة تأتي مرحلة دخول الناس الجنة أو النار ،الكفار يدخلون جهنم للأبد لا يوجد ماء ولا طعام كلما نمت جلود الكفار في جهنم يبدلون جلودا غيرها وهكذا الحال إلى الأبد مع العذاب الشديد وطعامهم في جهنم يكون الشوك ،وهكذا إلى الأبد،أمّا أصحاب الجنة وهم المسلمون فهم ينعمون في الجنة إلى الأبد ويوجد في الجنة أنهار من كل ما تشتهي الأنفس، وقصور من فضة وذهب ،ولباس من حرير ،وطعام من كل ما تشتهي الأنفس ،أهل الجنة لا يمرضون ،ولا ينزل منهم العرق في الجنة،يكونون في سعادة تامة إلى الأبد ،لا يزدادوا في العمر ،ولا يملون في الجنة ،وهكذا كله إلى الأبد إلى الأبد. 
فتخيل معي يا أخي لما لا تريد أن تصبح مسلما ،كل هذه الخيرات تريد أن تهدرها على نفسك ،أنصحك

"Hey Felix, 
I've been following your content on YouTube all the way from 2010/11, as a huge fan of yours and just kind of grew along with you.

Just last year on the 2nd of June my little daughter was born, right around the same time as your son. Watching your content now feels so rewarding. It feels like I've made it all this way and finally gotten to a point of rest, where I'm just happy with my life. Fatherhood has been such a blessing. All those sleepless nights and struggles get washed away by the beauty of watching your little one grow up into a happy and healthy little human. 
I'm sure you can agree. 

Following your content and kind of experiencing all of this for the first time, just as you do really helps with all the first time dad-anxiety. 

If you ever read this, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all these years of content and entertainment, growing alongside you and funnily enough becoming a dad at a simular time. We've had a simular evolution of interests and I could always watch and enjoy your content, never missing a video. 

Especially your more philosophical and thoughtful videos resonated so much with me and this newer form of content/vlog you seem to do mostly for yourself is my favourite by far.

I wish you and your family all the happiness, peace and excitement in the world.

"Pewds, you seem like a nice guy and you're out here 'living your best life.' But don't you ever just marvel at these awestrucking wonders of nature you get to see? Surely, mother nature in all its glory didn't assemble and engineer itself? Also, who coded our genes to eventually develop into fully functional bodies? Don't even get me started about our brain's capacity!

Truth is, we're created by a genius and loving Creator who longs for us to draw closer to Him. 

""He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us"" (Acts 17:26-27)

He's also blessed you so much and gotten you so far. Don't you want to get to know Him? If so, I challenge you to ask Him to reveal Himself to you. Simple as that. 

I would love for you and your family to gain eternal life and to know and experience that—as amazing as your life may seem right now—this world is not all there is.

"4 leaf clover ♥

last time we visited my MiL, my daughter (6) was hunting for four leaf clovers. We walked around their yard, and I found some... usually if you find one (didn't pick it at this point), there are others near it. 

So i had my daughter and MiL come over to where i was, and we hunted there.

My daughter found one of the four leaf clovers and she was so excited. MiL found one too. Ended up being at least 3 in that little patch of clover.

They're pressed in a book at MiL's house currently. Going to tape them with packing tape to 'laminate' them so can keep them forever. 

♥


Anyway, love seeing yall so happy! and the lil' man is growing up so fast.
they all do.

"This might be my favorite ""vlog episode"" yet. It has everything:

Björn starting to really interact with everything and everyone around, Italy and its beautiful plains and mountains, the food, the nostalgia hit while going back to that basement where everything started, the friends you made along the way and that are still here to enjoy a treck with you around a lake, the swedes houses, the forest where you can boulder to, your parents taking time to babysit their grandson but also following and helping you bouldering...

It has everything. Family, friends, busy airports, fields, lakes, mountains, forests, rocks, pizza, houses, memories... This may be a pretty ""common"" way of enjoying various things of life to its fullest, but these vlogs always capture and transcribe those moments so purely it feels genuinely like the best life anyone could have.
